               <h1 class="text"><strong>what is guitar ...??<strong></h1>
						<p class="lead"><b>The guitar is a popular musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from 4 to 18 strings, usually having 6.
						The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical amplification (for an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar, respectively).
						It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the right hand while fretting (or pressing against the fret) the strings with the left hand. 
						The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. 
						The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.</b></p>

      <h3>Acoustic guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/01.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/01.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
	<p>The acoustic guitar lends itself to a variety of tasks and roles.
	Its portabilityand ease of use make it the ideal songwriter's tool.
	Its gentle harp­like arpeggios and rhythmic chordal strumming has always found favor in an
ensemble. 
The acoustic guitar has a personal and intimate quality that is
suited to small halls, churches and private spaces. 
For larger venues some form of amplification is required. 
An acoustic guitar can be amplified by
placing a microphone in front of the sound hole or by installing a pickup.
There are many entry­level acoustic guitar models that are manufactured to a high standard and these are entirely suitable as a first guitar for beginners.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Electric guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/02.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/02.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p><strong>Electric guitars are solid­bodied guitars that are designed to be plugged into an amplifier. The electric guitar
when amplified produces a sound that is metallic with a lengthy decay. The shape of the electric guitar is
not determined by the need for a deep resonating body and this had led to the development of contoured and
thin bodied electric guitars. The two most popular designs are the Fender Stratocaster and the Gibson Les
Paul.
Electric guitar strings are thinner than acoustic guitar strings and closer to the neck and therefore less force
is needed to press them down. The ease with which you can bend strings, clear access to the twelfth
position, the use of a whammy bar and the manipulation of pots and switches whilst playing has led to the
development of a lead guitar style that is unique to the instrument. Fret­tapping is a guitar technique for
creating chords and melody lines that are not possible using the standard technique of left­hand fretting and
right­hand strumming. The sustain, sensitive pick­ups, low action and thin strings of the electric guitar
make it an ideal instrument for fret­tapping.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Electro acoustic guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/03.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/03.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>Electro­acoustic guitars have pickups that are specifically designed to reproduce the subtle nuances of the
acoustic guitar timbre. Electro­acoustic pickups are designed to sound neutral with little alteration to the
acoustic tone. The Ovation range of electro­acoustic guitars have under­the­saddle piezo pickups and a
synthetic bowl­back design. The synthetic bowl­back ensures a tough construction that stands up to the
rigours of the road while offering less feedback at high volumes. Ovation were the first company to provide
on­board equalization and this is now a standard feature. The Taylor electro­acoustic range uses the
traditional all­wood construction and the necks of these guitars have a reputation for superb action and
playability. Yamaha, Maton and many other companies manufacture electro­acoustic guitars and the buyer
is advised to test as many models and makes as they can while taking note of the unplugged and amplified
sound.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Twelve­string guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/04.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/04.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>The twelve­string guitar is a simple variation of the normal six string design. Twelve­string guitars have six
regular strings and a second set of thinner strings. Each string of the second set corresponds to the note of
its regular string counterpart. The strings form pairs and therefore you play a twelve­string guitar in the
same manner as you would a standard six­string.
Twelve­string guitars produce a brighter and more jangly tone than six­string guitars. They are used by
guitarists for chord progressions that require thickening. The twelve­string is mainly used as a rhythm
instrument due to the extra effort involved in playing lead guitar using paired strings. Twelve­string guitars
have twelve tuning pegs and double truss rods and are slightly more expensive then their corresponding sixstring version.</p>
</div>
	  <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Archtop guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/05.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/05.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>The archtop is a semi­hollow steel­string acoustic or electric guitar. The arched table combined with violinstyle f­holes and internal sound­block creates a timbre that is acoustic and mellow. These two factors have
made archtops a firm favourite with jazz guitarists.
Acoustic and electric archtops are identical in design with the only difference
being the addition of electro­magnetic pickups and pots. Archtops can either
be full­bodied or thinline. The full­bodied archtop retains good volume and
acoustic resonance when played unplugged though feedback may be an issue
when amplified. The thinline body minimizes feedback by sacrificing
acoustic volume and resonance.
The archtop is one of the most aesthetically pleasing guitar designs and
makers usually adhere to very high standards of construction and playability.
These factors ensure its continuing popularity with guitarists.</p>
    </div>
<div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>steel guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/06.jpeg"><img src="img/portfolio/06.jpeg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>The steel guitar is unusual in that it is played horizontally across the player's
lap. The steel guitar originates from Hawaii where local musicians, newly
introduced to the European guitar, developed a style of playing involving
alternative tunings and the use of a slide. The Hawaiian guitarists found that
by laying the guitar flat across the lap they could better control the slide. In
response to this new playing style some Hawaiian steel guitars were
constructed with a small rectangular body which made them more suitable for
laying across the lap.
There are two types of steel guitar played with a steel, the solid metal bar from which the guitar takes its
name, namely the lap steel guitar and the pedal steel guitar with its extra necks. The pedal steel guitar
comes on its own stand with a mechanical approach similar to the harp. Pedals and knee­levers are used to
alter the pitch of the strings whilst playing thereby extending the fluency of the glissandi technique.</p>
    </div>
<div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Resonator guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/07.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/07.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>Resonator guitars are distinctive for not having a regular sound hole instead they have a large circular
perforated cover plate which conceals a resonator cone. The cone is made from spun aluminum and
resembles a loudspeaker. The bridge is connected to either the center or edge of the cone by an aluminum
spring called the spider. The vibrations from the spider are projected by the cone through the perforated
cover plate. The most common resonator guitars have a single cone although the original model patented in
April 1927 by John Dopyera had three and was called a tricone resophonic guitar. Resonator guitars are
loud and bright. They are popular with blues and country guitarists and can be played conventionally or
with a slide.
Some resonator guitars possess metal bodies and these are called steel guitars. This can lead to some
confusion with the Hawaiian guitar of the same name. They are two distinct instruments. The Hawaiian
steel guitar takes its name from the steel bar used to create the glissandi and the Resonator steel guitar refers
to the material used for the construction of the body.

<div id="menu7" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>bass guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/08.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/08.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>The bass guitar has a long neck (scale­length) and thick strings. The open strings of the bass guitar
corresponds to the four lowest strings of the guitar and are pitched an octave lower. The standard bass has
four strings though five and six string basses are available which extends the range of the instrument.
Though the bass guitar is the bass instrument of the guitar family and the double­bass is the bass instrument
of the orchestral string family their similar roles have drawn bass players to both instruments.

<div id="menu8" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>double­neck guitar</h3>
	  <div class="img">
			<a target="_blank" href="img/portfolio/09.jpg"><img src="img/portfolio/09.jpg" alt="Klematis" width="300" height="300"></a>
			</div>
      <p>The double­neck guitar is designed so that two guitar necks can share one body. This design allows the
guitarist to switch between either neck with ease. The double­neck guitar will normally have a standard sixstring neck and a twelve­string neck though other combinations, such as a six­string neck and bass neck and
a six­string neck and fretless neck, are available. The double­neck guitar may be used in live situations
when a guitarist needs a twelve­string guitar for the rhythm part and a six­string guitar for the solo break.
